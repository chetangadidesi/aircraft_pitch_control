# Aircraft Pitch Control System Analysis and Airfoil Visualization

This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes the pitch dynamics of an aircraft using various control techniques. It includes open-loop and closed-loop response analysis, lead compensator design, LQR controller implementation with actuator lag, and 2D airfoil visualization with rotation. The project also evaluates system performance and control input effort over time.

## üìà Open-Loop System Response

The aircraft pitch transfer function is modeled as:

```matlab
P_pitch = (1.151*s + 0.1774)/(s^3 + 0.739*s^2 + 0.921*s);
```
A step response is generated for analysis, and system poles are examined to evaluate open-loop behavior.

---

## Frequency Response and Lead Compensator Design

To improve system stability and transient performance, a lead compensator is designed:

```matlab
C_lead = K * (T*s + 1) / (alpha*T*s + 1);
```
Bode plots and margin analysis are used to determine gain and phase margins. A closed-loop step response is plotted to observe improvements.

## LQR Controller with Actuator Lag

A more realistic control model is created by augmenting the system with actuator lag. State-space matrices are defined as:
```matlab
A_aug = [A, B; zeros(1,3), -1/tau];
B_aug = [zeros(3,1); 1/tau];
C_aug = [C, 0];
```
An LQR controller is designed with:
```matlab
K_aug = lqr(A_aug, B_aug, Q_aug, R);
```
The closed-loop system is simulated, and both the pitch angle response and control effort over time are visualized.

## Airfoil Shape and Rotation (NACA 2412)
The NACA 2412 airfoil is generated using standard thickness distribution equations:
```matlab
y = 0.12 * (0.2969 * sqrt(x) - 0.1260 * x - 0.3516 * x.^2 + 0.2843 * x.^3 - 0.1036 * x.^4);
```
The airfoil shape is centered and rotated using a 2D rotation matrix. Both original and rotated shapes are plotted to simulate pitch angle visually.

---

## Control Input Over Time
After applying the LQR controller, the control input u(t) is computed as:
```matlab
u = -K_aug * x' + Nbar * r;
```
This is plotted over time to evaluate the control effort required for tracking.

---

## Simulation from Non-Zero Initial State
The system is simulated from an initial state with a step reference input. The resulting pitch angle over time is plotted, showcasing system convergence and stability under the LQR controller with actuator lag.
